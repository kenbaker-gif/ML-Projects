## About

Welcome to **AI & ML Projects**! This repository contains projects I’ve built to **learn and practice AI and Machine Learning**.  

The projects cover a variety of topics, including:  

- 🤖 **Machine Learning** – regression, classification, and clustering  
- 🧠 **Neural Networks** – basic deep learning models  
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing** – working with text data  
- 🖼️ **Computer Vision** – image classification and processing  
- 📊 **Data Analysis and Visualization** – exploring datasets using Python  

Each project includes code, datasets and explanations of how I approached the problem. The goal is to **practice skills, learn by doing, and build a small portfolio** that shows what I can do.
